        <h1>GHC 8.8 Status</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Ben Gamari - 2019-04-04T12:51:28</h4>

<p>With the release of GHC 8.4 we discussed a reorganization of our release cycle, increasing the release frequency from roughly one release every twelve months to a predictable two releases per year. This aggressive increase in release frequency was to be enabled by reimagining of GHC’s continuous integration infrastructure, allowing us to reduce the cost of making releases while not compromising quality.</p>
<p>However, it took a few false-starts to realize the promise of the comprehensive CI rework that we envisioned. While an early attempt at <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20170801-jenkins-ci.html">Jenkins infrastructure</a> ultimately proved to be a dead-end, a second attempt at using CircleCI and Appveyor had significantly more traction. By the time of the 8.6.2 release we had sufficient CI infrastructure in place to make a few of our binary distributions via CI but we were still far from the comprehensive CI story necessary to sustain the accelerated schedule due to platform limitations and lacking build capacity.</p>
<p>Late last fall we resolved to consolidate GHC’s infrastructure on GitLab. While our original plan called for us to continue to use CircleCI and Appveyor as the basis for our testing infrastructure, circumstances eventually rendered this plan infeasible. However, nearly five months later we are <a href="20190403-infra-status.html">emerging</a> on the other side of this migration effort, not only with significantly streamlined contributor workflow but also most of the testing infrastructure that we have been seeking.</p>
<p>Needless to say, bringing this migration to a close ultimately required that we compromise on the 8.8.1 release schedule. According to our planned cadence, the 8.8 cycle was slated to begin in December 2018, three months after the release of 8.6.1. This would have started a succession of pre-releases which would culminate in a final release in mid-March 2019.</p>
<p>After we resolved to proceed with the GitLab migration I had tentatively planned to push this cycle back, starting the alpha releases shortly after the expected conclusion of <a href="20190403-infra-status.html">phase 2</a> of the GitLab migration in February 2019. This timeframe ended up being a bit optimistic but I believe we are now in a place where we can begin realistically restart release engineering work (and indeed I have been busily preparing the <code>ghc-8.6</code> and <code>ghc-8.8</code> branches over the past weeks).</p>
<p>At this point our plan is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the next few days we will be pushing out a 8.6.5-alpha1 release. This will include a few important bug fixes as well as some packaging issues, particularly affecting Windows</p>
<p>Assuming no serious regressions are reported the final 8.6.5 release will be cut a week later, likely marking the end of the 8.6 series.</p></li>
<li><p>Once 8.6.5-alpha1 is out we will aim to quickly turnaround an 8.8.1-alpha1. Thanks to the <code>head.hackage</code> infrastructure introduced <a href="20190403-infra-status.html">earlier</a> we have already had some experience building user code with this branch and hope to move quickly through one or two pre-releases, culminating in a final 8.8.1 release in mid-May.</p></li>
<li><p>We will plan on starting the alpha cycle for 8.10 in mid-June, as previously planned.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All-in-all this schedule should allow us to proceed in cutting 8.8.1 (and subsequent minor releases) with little-to-no effect on the 8.10 series.</p>
<p>I am also happy to share that we have been working on a few of other exciting projects in GHC-land in the past months, concurrently to the GitLab migration. I look forward to sharing more about these in a future post.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards!</p>
