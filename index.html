<h2> Tools for working on GHC <small class="text-muted"> June 11, 2019 </small> </span> </h2>
     
        <p>In the old days of the Make build system, the only reliable IDE-like feature which was useful whilst working on GHC was a tags file. Even loading GHC into GHCi was not easily possible, the most simple of interactive development workflows. Thankfully now times are changing, there are now build targets to start a GHCi session which enables developers to use tooling such as <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid">ghcid</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dramforever.vscode-ghc-simple">vscode-ghc-simple</a>. Something which is quite important when working on a project with over 500 modules!</p>
<p>In this post we’ll briefly describe some recent advancements in developer tooling which have been made possible by the move to Hadrian.</p>

<h2> Making use of GHC bindists built by GitLab CI <small class="text-muted"> June 11, 2019 </small> </span> </h2>
     
        <p>The new GHC GitLab CI infrastructure builds hundreds of different commits a week. Each commit on <code>master</code> is built, as well as any merge requests; each build produces an bindist which can be downloaded and installed on the relevant platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mpickering/ghc-artefact-nix"><code>ghc-artefact-nix</code></a> provides a program <code>ghc-head-from</code> which downloads and enters a shell providing an artefact built with GitLab CI.</p>

<h2> A three-stage program you definitely want to write <small class="text-muted"> February 14, 2019 </small> </span> </h2>
     
        <p>Writing programs explicitly in stages gives you guarantees that abstraction will be removed. A guarantee that the optimiser most certainly does not give you.</p>
<p>After spending the majority of my early 20s inside the optimiser, I decided enough was enough and it was time to gain back control over how my programs were partially evaluated.</p>
<p>So in this post I’ll give an example of how I took back control and eliminated two levels of abstraction for an interpreter by writing a program which runs in three stages.</p>
<p>Enter: An applicative interpreter for Hutton’s razor.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Expr</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Val</span> <span class="dt">Int</span> <span class="fu">|</span> <span class="dt">Add</span> <span class="dt">Expr</span> <span class="dt">Expr</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" data-line-number="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="ot">eval ::</span> <span class="dt">Applicative</span> m <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Expr</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m <span class="dt">Int</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" data-line-number="4">eval (<span class="dt">Val</span> n) <span class="fu">=</span> pure n</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" data-line-number="5">eval (<span class="dt">Add</span> e1 e2) <span class="fu">=</span> (<span class="fu">+</span>) <span class="fu">&lt;$&gt;</span> eval e1 <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> eval e2</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Written simply at one level, there are two levels of abstraction which could be failed to be eliminated.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If we statically know the expression we can eliminate <code>Expr</code>.</li>
<li>If we statically know which <code>Applicative</code> then we can remove the indirection from the typeclass.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using typed Template Haskell we’ll work out how to remove both of these layers.</p>

<h2> Implementing Nested Quotations <small class="text-muted"> January 31, 2019 </small> </span> </h2>
     
        <p>Quotation is one of the key elements of metaprogramming. Quoting an expression <code>e</code> gives us a representation of <code>e</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[| e |] :: Repr</code></pre>
<p>What this representation is depends on the metaprogramming framework and what we can do with the representation depends on the representation. The most common choice is to dissallow any inspection of the representation type relying on the other primative operation, the splice, in order to insert quoted values into larger programs.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to explain how to implemented nested quotations. From our previous example, quoting a term <code>e</code>, gives us a term which represents <code>e</code>. It follows that we should be allowed to nest quotations so that quoting a quotation gives us a representation of that quotation.</p>
<pre><code>[| [| 4 + 5 |] |]</code></pre>
<p>However, nesting brackets in this manner has been disallowed in Template Haskell for a number of years despite nested splices being permitted. I wondered why this restriction was in place and it seemed that <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2019-January/016939.html">no one knew the answer</a>. It turns out, there was no technical reason and implementing nested brackets is straightforward once you think about it correctly.</p>

<h2> Packaging a Haskell library for artefact evaluation using nix <small class="text-muted"> September 19, 2018 </small> </span> </h2>
     
        <p>This year I packaged two artefacts for the ICFP artefact evaluation process. This post explains the system I used to make it easy to produce the docker images using nix. I hope this documentation will be useful for anyone else submitting a Haskell library for evaluation.</p>
<p>The end result will be an <code>artefact.nix</code> file which is used to build a docker image to submit. It will be an entirely reproducible process as we will fix the versions of all the dependencies we use.</p>
